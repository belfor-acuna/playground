# Playground - Belfor's Experiments

## Introduction

Hi! In this project, I tried something new, which is why itâ€™s called Belforâ€™s Experiments. Long story short, I wanted to create a backend playground for my portfolio ([Check out my portfolio](https://belfor-acuna-portfolio.onrender.com))
 and decided to showcase different frameworks with interesting functionalities in various languages.

## Situation
As you may know, students donâ€™t have a lot of budget to host several projects on multiple hosts or buckets.
So the first thing that came to my mind was: Can I actually deploy a repository with more than one framework on just one VPS?
I had never done this before, so it was a new question to solve. ðŸ˜…

## Solution
I remembered my Software Engineering course, took the time to re-investigate how to accomplish this, and my conclusion was to create a mono-repo where I could group everything together. As you can see, this repository currently contains two frameworks:

    Express.js
    NestJS

These are interconnected by an API Gateway built with Kong, which routes the traffic to each container inside a Docker network.

## How does it work?
This repository contains two main directories, each corresponding to a different backend framework:

- **expressPlayground**: Contains the Express.js framework source code.
- **nestPlayground**: Contains the NestJS framework source code.

Each directory has:

- A Dockerfile to build the container for the respective framework.
- Framework-specific files (e.g., package.json and any necessary source files).

The project structure is as follows:
```
/Playground
  â”œâ”€â”€ /expressPlayground
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /src
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ /nestPlayground
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ /src
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.ts
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
  â”œâ”€â”€ kong.yml
  â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yml
  â”œâ”€â”€ .env
  â””â”€â”€ README.md

```
## Docker Compose & Kong API Gateway
In the root directory, we have:

- **kong.yml**: The Kong API Gateway configuration file.

- **compose.yml**: The Docker Compose configuration file, which manages the containers and services.

First, the docker compose file is responsible for the following:

1. Building the Docker containers for the two frameworks (Express.js and NestJS).

    - It specifies the context for the Docker build, which includes the source code and Dockerfile for each framework.
    - The Dockerfile installs dependencies and runs the framework inside the container.

2. Starting the Kong API Gateway container.

    - The kong.yml config file is used to configure Kong to route traffic to the correct backend containers.
    - Additional configurations for Kong (like logging and access settings) are included in the environment section, following the official [Kong documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/get-started/).

3. Creating a Docker network for the containers to communicate with each other.

    - This network is managed by the Kong API Gateway.

# How Kong routes traffic
Kong is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate service (i.e., the backend containers). In the kong.yml config file, you define services and routes:

- **Services** represent the backend containers that Kong will route traffic to.

- **Routes**  define the specific endpoints that Kong will expose and direct traffic to.

For example, in the case of the Express.js framework, there is a route /testexpress. The Kong configuration includes a service pointing to the expresscontainer, with a route identifier like express-test. The path /testexpress is mapped to this service, so any request to http://<kong_gateway>/testexpress will be routed to the expresscontainer.


## Setup

Follow the next steps if you want to use this!

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/belfor-acuna/playground
    ```
2. Select the proyect directory
    ```
    cd playground
    ```
3. Initialize git flow
    ```
    git flow init
    ```
4. Make sure you are in the branch "develop" using
    ```
    git branch
    ```
5. Make sure to have docker engine and docker compose plugin in your system, if you don't, you can check the documentation at https://docs.docker.com/engine/

6. Create a .env in the root directory that includes AT LEAST the express port variable(This is used for the express API in compose.yml file)
    ```
    EXPRESS_PORT = 3001 (Or whichever you want)
    ```
7. Build the containers using docker compose
    ```
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
8. Try it! to test an express route:
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8000/testexpress
    ```
9. To test a nestJS route:
    ```
    curl http://localhost:8000/
    ```
